      My research advances the way we use machine learning and statistical tools to drive biomedical research. As healthcare data becomes increasingly ubiquitous, improving data-driven biomedical research is timely and important. There is a rush to learn from these new sources of data, and to implement research findings into clinical practice. Hence, it is important to learn reliable and actionable information from the data with real clinical implications. My goal is to go beyond standard machine learning to do reliable causal learning with healthcare data, by leveraging ML models' expressivity to learn from high dimensional observational and experimental data. I keep myself grounded by applying the methods I develop to real data from a variety of healthcare applications. These help motivate my research and provide fruitful opportunities to continue to develop practical machine learning algorithms.

      I am advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~basus/">Dr. Sanjay
      Basu</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/Bio.HTML">Lu Tian</a>.
      I collaborate with <a href="http://stanford.edu/~jduchi/">John
      C. Duchi</a> and his group on topics related to machine learning and
      stochastic optimization.

    <h3>Beyond research</h3>
    <p>
      I help run
      the <a href="https://stanfordlindyproject.wordpress.com">Stanford Lindy
      Project</a>, a fun (if I do say so myself) group of Stanford students and
      community members that share an interest in swing and Lindy hop as a
      social dance. If you're interested, either come to a Stanford Lindy
      Project event (held every Monday night: check Facebook) or
      reach out to one of us. I promise we don't bite!
